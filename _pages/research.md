I am broadly interested in combinatorial algebraic geometry.

## Papers: 

<details>
<summary>Chow-Lam Recovery (<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02691">preprint</a>, with Kristian Ranestad)</summary>
<hr>
We explore the extend to which a subvariety of the Grassmannian can be uniquely recovered from its Chow-Lam form. Unlike the classical case of Chow forms for projective varieties, this is not always possible, and we provide several interesting families of counter-examples.

<summary>Wondertopes (<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04610">preprint</a>, with Sarah Brauner, Chris Eur, and Raluca Vlad)</summary>
<hr>
We provide a new type of positive geometry called a wondertope (wonderful polytope). It is constructed by pulling back an open region of a hyperplane arrangement to the wonderful compatification of the arrangement, then taking the Euclidean closure.

<details>
<summary>The Chow-Lam Form (<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10795">preprint</a>, with Bernd Sturmfels)</summary>
<hr>
We introduce the Chow-Lam form for subvarieties of the Grassmannian, generalizing the classical Chow form. This gives us universal formulas for projections between Grassmannians and their branch loci.

<summary> 
Combinatorics of m=1 Grasstopes (<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09603">preprint</a>, with Yelena Mandelshtam and Dmitrii Pavlov) </summary>

<hr>
Grasstopes are a generalization of amplituhedra. Building on work of Karp and Williams on the m=1 amplituhedron, we show that m=1 Grasstopes consist of regions of a hyperplane arrangement characterized by a sign condition.

<details>
<summary> 
D-Module Techniques for Solving Differential Equations in the Context of Feynman Integrals (<a href = "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11005-024-01835-7">Letters in Mathematical Physics</a> 2024, with Johannes Henn, Anna-Laura Sattelberger, and Simone Zoia) </summary>

<hr>
We use D-module methods to construct series solutions to linear differential equations appearing in the context of Feynman integrals. 
<hr>
<!---In particular, we implement an algorithm due to Saito, Sturmfels, and Takayama to compute canonical series solutions of regular holonomic D-ideals, and compare them to asymptotic series derived from the respective Fuchsian systems.--->

<summary>
On the Geometry of Elliptic Pairs (<a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022404923000063"> Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra </a> 2023) </summary>

<hr>
In this paper we classify toric elliptic pairs of Picard number two. These elliptic pairs are used to construct examples of surfaces whose pseudo-effective cone is non-polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density, and, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density.

<details>
<summary>Quantum Jacobi forms and sums of tails identities (<a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357040393_Quantum_Jacobi_forms_and_sums_of_tails_identities">Research in Number Theory</a> 2022, with Amanda Folsom, Noah Solomon, and Andrew Tawfeek)</summary>
<hr>
We discover new examples of hypergeometric series which are quantum Jacobi forms, i.e. satisfy a modular transformation property up to an analytic error term.
