I am broadly interested in combinatorial algebraic geometry. Most of my work is in positive geometry, which studies semi-algebraic subsets of real algebraic varieties defined by natural positivity conditions. The Ur-example is the positive Grassmannian, and other examples include polytopes, the moduli space of points on a line, and positive parts of many homogeneous spaces. This is a relatively new field of math inspired by computations in scattering amplitudes.

## Preprints

<details>
<summary>Avoidance Loci of Real Projective Varieties (<a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15888">preprint</a>, with Ada Wang)</summary>
<hr>
We define the avoidance locus to consist of real linear spaces intersecting a real projective variety at no real point. This generalizes the cone of positive polynomials, which consists of hyperplanes avoiding the Veronese variety. We prove that the avoidance locus is a union of non-adjacent regions in the complement of a higher Chow form.

<summary>Exterior Cyclic Polytopes and Convexity of Amplituhedra (<a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17620">preprint</a>, with Elia Mazzucchelli)</summary>
<hr>
We show that the k=m=2 amplituhedron is the intersection of Gr(2,4) with a polytope, which we call the exterior cyclic polytope. Furthermore, we described the dual of this polytope in terms of the twist map of Marsh and Scott, and use this to define a notion of dual amplituhedron.

<summary>The Segre Determinant (<a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09204">preprint</a>)</summary>
<hr>
The Segre determinant is a polynomial which encodes the condition for points to lie on a bilinear hypersurface in the product of projective spaces. We show that the Segre determinant represents the Chow-Lam form of a generic torus orbit in the Grassmannian, and gives some applications to algebraic vision and to Chow quotients of Grassmannians.

<summary>FrontierMath: A Benchmark for Evaluating Advanced Mathematical Reasoning in AI (<a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04872">preprint</a>, with many co-authors)</summary>
<hr>
I contributed some problems to this problem bank, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating AI performance. The paper explains the methodology in more detail and evaluates several leading models on this problem set.

## Papers

<summary>Chow-Lam Recovery (<a href = "https://lematematiche.dmi.unict.it/index.php/lematematiche">Le Matematiche</a> 2025, with Kristian Ranestad)</summary>
<hr>
We explore the extent to which a subvariety of the Grassmannian can be uniquely recovered from its Chow-Lam form. Unlike the classical case of Chow forms for projective varieties, this is not always possible, and we provide several interesting families of counter-examples.

<summary>Wondertopes (<a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870825004141">Advances in Math</a> 2025, with Sarah Brauner, Chris Eur, and Raluca Vlad)</summary>
<hr>
We provide a new type of positive geometry called a wondertope (wonderful polytope). It is constructed by pulling back an open region of a hyperplane arrangement to the wonderful compatification of the arrangement, then taking the Euclidean closure.

<summary>The Chow-Lam Form (<a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074771712500032X">Journal of Symbolic Computation</a> 2025, with Bernd Sturmfels)</summary>
<hr>
We introduce the Chow-Lam form for subvarieties of the Grassmannian, generalizing the classical Chow form. This gives us universal formulas for projections between Grassmannians and their branch loci.

<summary> 
Combinatorics of m=1 Grasstopes (<a href = "https://escholarship.org/uc/item/71d8d238">Journal of Combinatorial Theory </a>, with Yelena Mandelshtam and Dmitrii Pavlov) </summary>

<hr>
Grasstopes are a generalization of amplituhedra. Building on work of Karp and Williams on the m=1 amplituhedron, we show that m=1 Grasstopes consist of regions of a hyperplane arrangement characterized by a sign condition.

<summary> 
D-Module Techniques for Solving Differential Equations in the Context of Feynman Integrals (<a href = "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11005-024-01835-7">Letters in Mathematical Physics</a>> 2024, with Johannes Henn, Anna-Laura Sattelberger, and Simone Zoia) </summary>

<hr>
We use D-module methods to construct series solutions to linear differential equations appearing in the context of Feynman integrals. 
<hr>
<!---In particular, we implement an algorithm due to Saito, Sturmfels, and Takayama to compute canonical series solutions of regular holonomic D-ideals, and compare them to asymptotic series derived from the respective Fuchsian systems.--->

<summary>
On the Geometry of Elliptic Pairs (<a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022404923000063"> Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra </a> 2023) </summary>

<hr>
In this paper we classify toric elliptic pairs of Picard number two. These elliptic pairs are used to construct examples of surfaces whose pseudo-effective cone is non-polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density, and, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, polyhedral for a set of primes of positive density.

<summary>Quantum Jacobi forms and sums of tails identities (<a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357040393_Quantum_Jacobi_forms_and_sums_of_tails_identities">Research in Number Theory</a> 2022, with Amanda Folsom, Noah Solomon, and Andrew Tawfeek)</summary>
<hr>
We discover new examples of hypergeometric series which are quantum Jacobi forms, i.e. satisfy a modular transformation property up to an analytic error term.
